# ATM

This APP created in Ruby mimics an Automated Teller Machine (ATM)

### Prerequisites
- Ruby 2.4 
- Text Editor (e.g. Atom, Sublime)
- Terminal (for Mac) or Windows Powershell

### Installing
The first thing to do is to make sure that you have installed Ruby and a Text Editor in your system.

### Running the App
On a Terminal or Powershell run the program by locating the directory of the file and calling (e.g "ruby filename.rb")

### How The App Works
At the start of the transaction, the ATM is preloaded with a certain amount. The program will require an ATM card that need to be inserted. 
It will then ask for a 6-digit pin.It will proceed with showing the basic transaction which are Balance Inquiry, Withdrawal and Transfer.  Selection is done by 
choosing the number. After that, it will ask if there is another transaction.

If yes, it will then go back to the menu. If the prior is transaction is withdrawal and the next is transaction is balance inquiry, 
it will show the running balance.
